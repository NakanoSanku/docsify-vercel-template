# Docsify Template
This directory is a brief example of a [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) site that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration.
This version is created by [NakanoSanku](https://github.com/NakanoSanku), which uses the latest docsify version and fixed some bugs compared to the official template.
